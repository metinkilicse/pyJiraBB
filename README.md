### write a script to create bitbucket project and repository with the information from jira. (Note: Project name should be same with Bitbucket project name and Repository name should be same with Bitbucket Repository Name.)
* script should select issues of jira with project key BR and status To Do.
* script should read values of Bitbucket Project Name, Bitbucket Repository Name fields
* script should open a new bitbucket project with Bitbucket Project Name if the project not exists
* script should open a new bitbucket repository with Bitbucket Repository Name under project with Bitbucket Project Name
* script should update(create transition) jira issue. After the process jira issue should have status "Done"

## Using

* Use as "python pyJiraBB.py BR 'To Do'"
